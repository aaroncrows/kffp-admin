Freak folk, psych rock. Field recordings… Hauntology. Lichenthropy. \n\nSometimes it’s like getting a lap dance at the butoh performance. Bees in your heart, fleas up your spine. \n\nRarely painful, more like an intermittent but persistent, muted drumming you can’t quite place. Something “else,” lodged up in there, and you don’t know if it’s digging its way out or digging in. \n\nSometimes it skips, like a broken thing, like a heartbeat. \n\nYou know what it’s like, don’t you?"

The music programming would include work by that creative, work that inspired that artist, and work I felt complimented or similarly was inspired by common aspects of the conversation. "

This could be something broad like bands from a certain country, or a very specific genre, or a broad theme like \"songs about _______\".  I think working with a theme would keep it more focused and get me to delve in deeper to the genres/artists that I already love  and find new ones too. as well as keep the show more interesting for the listener.  I also had a few guests in over the past few months and I enjoyed collaborating with them on playlists too, so I would like to have more guests as well this time around!"

The show will be 1/3rd talk and 2/3rds music, and the music is eclectic by definition because weekly guests determine the playlist. The DJs engage guests in discussions about how music affects their artistic practice, which music obsessions they have and why, memories of the local music and art scene, and what makes them tick creatively in general. More of a casual conversation than an interview, Studio Visit desires to uncover hidden sides of the local art scene in an idiosyncratic, random and synesthetic way."
